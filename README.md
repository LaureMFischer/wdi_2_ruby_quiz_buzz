# QuizBuzz

FizzBuzz is an extremely common early screening question in interviews for programming jobs.

It is a simple problem that is given with the purpose of filtering out people who simply can't program, without requiring a program with much complexity.

We're going to bump the difficulty up just a bit however to ensure that you can always knock it out of the park on FizzBuzz

## Instructions

**Do not search online or use your notes.** 

This quiz is rare in that it must be done from memory, as it is possible that an interviewer will ask you to complete FizzBuzz in front of them without a reference.

Use RSpec and TDD (write test first, code second) to write a *method* called `fizz_buzz` that does the following:

* `fizz_buzz` takes a single input argument of `x`
* If `x` is divisible by 3, return a string of `fizz`
* If `x` is divisible by 5, return a string of `buzz`
* If `x` is divisible by both 3 *and* 5, return a string of `fizzbuzz`

## Evaluatory Points

3 points are given for the `fizz_buzz` method working properly. These are all or nothing, as an employer will not accept a partial solution.

1 point is given for good tests that pass.

1 point is given for excellent style (proper indentation, solid logic)
